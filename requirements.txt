Install httpPlatformHandler on the IIS

The Easiest Fix (Using the IIS Manager GUI):

1.Open IIS Manager on your server.

2.In the "Connections" pane on the left, click on your server's name (the top-level item in the tree).

3.In the main "Features View" (in the middle), find and double-click on "Configuration Editor".

4.In the "Section" dropdown box at the top, navigate to this section: system.webServer -> handlers

5.In the "Actions" pane on the far right, you will see an option that says "Unlock Section". Click it.
(If it says "Lock Section", then it's already unlocked, and our problem is something else—but 99% of the time, it will say "Unlock Section".)

6.After you click "Unlock Section", you don't even need to restart IIS. Just go back to your browser and refresh the page for your kiosk app.
